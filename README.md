# Sql_Data_Warehouse_Project
Building modern Data Warehouse with Sql Server, Including ETL processes, data modeling, and analitics.

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project Repository! 🚀
This repository demonstrates a practical solution for building and utilizing a data warehouse. From designing the architecture to generating insights, it reflects real-world applications of data engineering and analytics, emphasizing scalability and efficiency.


## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a robust and scalable data warehousing solution, built using the Medallion Architecture. It’s structured into three key layers:

Bronze Layer: Raw, unprocessed data directly from source systems.
Silver Layer: Cleaned and transformed data, ready for analysis.
Gold Layer: Aggregated, business-ready data for advanced analytics and reporting.
Key Features:

ETL Pipelines: Seamless extraction, transformation, and loading processes to ensure reliable data flow.
Data Modeling: Carefully designed fact and dimension tables for efficient and optimized analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Leveraging SQL to create insightful reports and dashboards that drive decision-making.
Roles & Skills Applied:

Data Architecture and Engineering
ETL Pipeline Development
Advanced Data Modeling Techniques
Data Analytics and SQL Reporting
This project demonstrates how modern data practices come together to deliver a complete end-to-end analytics solution.



## 🚀 Project Requirements

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering):
This project centers on creating a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to consolidate sales data for analytical reporting and better decision-making.

### Key Objectives:

Develop a Centralized Data Warehouse: Integrate data from multiple systems into a unified repository.
Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance: Address inconsistencies and ensure the data is reliable for analysis.
Streamlined Integration: Merge ERP and CRM datasets into a cohesive, user-friendly analytical model.
Focus on Recency: Prioritize the latest available data without incorporating historical tracking.
Comprehensive Documentation: Deliver clear, concise documentation for both business users and analytics teams to facilitate understanding and usability.



## 📊 BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

### Objective:
Leverage SQL-based analytics to uncover actionable insights across critical business areas:

Customer Behavior: Analyze purchasing patterns, preferences, and engagement levels to identify opportunities for customer retention and growth.
Product Performance: Evaluate sales performance, profitability, and product trends to inform inventory and marketing strategies.
Sales Trends: Track revenue patterns, seasonal variations, and regional performance to guide strategic planning.

### Bronze Layer: 
Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
### Silver Layer:
This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
### Gold Layer: 
Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
